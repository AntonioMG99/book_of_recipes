# Basil pesto
Originally from Genoa, Italy, pesto traces its name to the Italian word "pestare," which means "to crush or pound." For hundreds of years, pesto was made by pounding the ingredients in a mortar and pestle. It dates back from Roman times when Genoans would crush walnuts with herbs and garlic.

The most popular variety of pesto now is made by "crushing" basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil and some hard cheese in a food processor or blender. It's fun to use a mortar and pestle, but the modern way is much easier.

## Ingredients
* 2 cups fresh basil leaves, packed (can sub half the basil leaves with baby spinach)
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Romano or Parmesan cheese (about 2 ounces)
* 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
* 1/3 cup pine nuts (can sub chopped walnuts)
* 3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)
* 1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste
* 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or more to taste

## Instructions
* Pulse the basil and pine nuts
